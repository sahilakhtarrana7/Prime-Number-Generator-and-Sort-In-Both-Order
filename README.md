# Prime-Number-Generator-and-Sort-In-Both-Order
The project “Prime Number Generator and Sort in Both Order” is a C program that generates prime numbers within a given range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and sorts them in ascending and descending order. It demonstrates efficient algorithm use, logic building, and applications in cryptography and data analysis.
